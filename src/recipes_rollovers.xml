  <!-- === One Month Before ZSK Rollover === -->
  <section id="one-month-before-zsk-rollover">
   <title>One Month Before ZSK Rollover</title>

   <para>On December 1st, 2014, a month before the planned rollover, you should 
   change the parameters on the current key (17694) to become inactive on
   January 1st, 2015, and be deleted from the zone on February 1st, 2015, as
   well as generate a successor key (51623):</para>

   <para>The first command gets us into the key directory
   <filename>/etc/bind/keys/example.com/</filename>, where keys
   for <code>example.com</code> are stored.</para>

   <para>The second <command>dnssec-settime</command> sets an inactive (-I) date
   of January 1st, 2015, and a deletion (-D) date of February 1st, 2015 for the
   current ZSK (Kexample.com.+008+17694).</para>

   <para>Then the third command <command>dnssec-keygen</command> creates a
   successor key, using the exact same parameters (algorithms, key sizes, etc.)
   as the current ZSK. The new ZSK created in our example is
   Kexample.com.+008+51623. </para>

   <para>Don't forget to make sure the successor keys are readable by
   <command>named</command>.</para>

   <para>You can see in syslog the messages informing you when the next key
   checking event is, and it looks like this:</para>

   <screen>zone example.com/IN (signed): next key event: 01-Dec-2014 00:13:05.385</screen>

   <para>And you can check the publish date of the key by looking at the key
   file:</para>

   <screen># <userinput>cd /etc/bind/keys/example.com</userinput>
# cat Kexample.com.+008+51623.key 
; This is a zone-signing key, keyid 11623, for example.com.

; Activate: 20150101000000 (Thu Jan  1 08:00:00 2015)
...</screen>

   <para>Since the publish date is set to the morning of December 2nd, the next
   morning you will notice that your zone has gained a new DNSKEY record, but no
   corresponding RRSIG yet. Below is the abbreviated output with shortened DNSKEY
   and RRSIG when querying the authoritative name server, 192.168.1.13:</para>

   <para>And for good measures, let's take a look at the SOA record and its
   signature for this zone. Notice the RRSIG is signed by the current ZSK
   17694. This will come in handy later when you want to verify whether or not
   the new ZSK is in effect:</para>

   <para>These are all the manual tasks you need to perform for a ZSK rollover.

  <!-- === Day of ZSK Rollover === -->
  <section id="day-of-zsk-rollover">
   <title>Day of ZSK Rollover</title>

   <para>On the actual day of the rollover, although there is technically
   nothing for you to do, you should still keep an eye on the zone to make sure
   new signatures are being generated by the new ZSK (51623 in this
   example). The easiest way is to query the authoritative name
   server 192.168.1.13 for the SOA record like you did a month
   ago:</para>

...</screen>

   <para>As you can see, the signature generated by the old ZSK (17694)
   disappeared, replaced by a new signature generated from the new ZSK
   (51623).</para>

   <note>
    <title>Life Time of the Signatures</title>
    <para>Not all signatures will disappear magically on the same day,
    depending on when each one is generated. Worst case scenario is that a new
    signature could have been signed by the old ZSK (17695) moments before it
    was deactivated, thus the signature could live for almost 30 more days, all
    the way up to right before February 1st. </para>

    <para>This is why it is important that you should keep the old ZSK in the
    zone for a little bit longer and not delete it right away. </para> 

   </note>
  </section>

  <!-- === One Month After ZSK Rollover === -->
  <section id="one-month-after-zsk-rollover">
   <title>One Month After ZSK Rollover</title>
   <para>Again, technically there should be nothing you need to do on this day,
   but it doesn't hurt to verify that the old ZSK (17694) is now completely
   gone from your zone. <command>named</command> will not touch
   <filename>Kexample.com.+008+17694.private</filename> and
   <filename>Kexample.com.+008+17694.key</filename> on your file system.
   Running the same <command>dig</command> command for DNSKEY should
   suffice:</para>

  <title>KSK Rollover Recipe</title>

  <para>This recipe describes how to perform KSK rollover using the Double-DS
  method. For other KSK rolling methods, please see <xref

  linkend="dnssec-advanced-discussions" />. The registrar used in this recipe
  is <ulink url="https://www.godaddy.com" > <citetitle>GoDaddy</citetitle>
  </ulink>. Also for this recipe, we are keeping the number of DS records down
  to just one per active set using just SHA-1, for the sake of better clarity,
  although in practice most zone operators choose to upload 2 DS records as we
  have shown in <xref linkend="working-with-parent-zone" />. For more
  information on key management (such as what inactive date is, and why 30 days
  for example), please see <xref linkend="advanced-discussions-key-management"

   change the parameters on the current key to become inactive on January 1st,
   2015, and be deleted from the zone on February 1st, 2015, as well as
   generate a successor key (23550). Finally, you should generate a new DS

   <para>The fourth and final command <command>dnssec-dsfromkey</command>
   creates a DS record from the new KSK (23550), using SHA-1 as the digest

   supported digest types (SHA-1 and SHA-256), but for our example here we are
   only using one to keep the output small and hopefully clearer.</para>

   <para>Finally, let's verify that the registrar has published the new DS
   record. This may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, depending
   on your parent zone. You could verify whether or not your parent zone has
   published the new DS record by querying for the DS record of your zone. In
   the example below, the Google public DNS server 8.8.8.8 is used:</para>

   <title>Day of KSK Rollover</title>

   <para>If you have followed the examples in this document as described in <xref linkend="easy-start-guide-for-authoritative-servers" />, there is technically nothing you need to do manually on the actual day of the rollover. However, you should still keep an eye on the zone to make sure new signatures are being generated by the new KSK (23550 in this example). The easiest way is to query the authoritative name server 192.168.1.13 for the same DNSKEY and signatures like you did a month ago:</para>

   disappeared, replaced by a new signature generated from the new KSK

   <para>While the removal of the old DNSKEY from zone should be automated by
   <command>named</command>, the removal of the DS record is manual. You should
   make sure the old DNSKEY record is gone from your zone first by querying for
   the DNSKEY records of the zone, and this time we expect to see one less
   DNSKEY:</para>

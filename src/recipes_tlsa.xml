 <title>Self-signed Certificate Recipe</title>

 <para>This recipe describes how to configure DNS(SEC) to include a TLSA record
 that acts as a different channel to provide verification for a self-signed
 x509 (SSL) certificate.</para>

 <note>
  <para>TLSA is still in its infancy. One of the road blocks that exists as of
  late 2014 is the lack of application support in web browsers and mail
  applications. As these applications add support for TLSA, steps described in
  this recipe will become more relevant and practical. Today (as of late 2014),
  unfortunately, most applications lack native support and will likely result in
  some kind of error message or warning even if you have deployed TLSA
  correctly.</para>
 </note>

 <para>For this recipe, we are assuming that you already have a working web
 server configured with a self-signed x509 certificate. Although the steps
 described below works for self-signed certificates, it can also be used for
 "real" certificates that were signed by a Certificate Authority (usually a
 service you pay for). This is one of several possible uses of DNS-Based
 Authentication of Named Entities, or DANE (we briefly talked about DANE in
 <xref linkend="introduction-to-dane" />). </para>

 <para>First, let's take a look at the certificate used by you web
 server:</para>

 <screen># <userinput>cat server.crt</userinput>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

-----END CERTIFICATE-----</screen>

 <para>Next, use <command>openssl</command> to generate a SHA-256 fingerprint
 of this certificate, this is what you will list in DNS as a TLSA record. Also,
 you need to remove all the colons, hence the added <command>sed</command> at
 the end to filter out all ":" characters:</para>

 <screen># <userinput>openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 &lt; server.crt | tr -d :</userinput>
SHA256 Fingerprint=294874DA378148CDD1B9C57D2E891E8C294D2958F0BCA7400A0D6D6F50C4A3BB</screen>

 <para>Now you can insert the TLSA record by editing the zone file the old
 fashioned way, or if your DNS server is allowing dynamic updates, you could
 use <command>nsupdate</command> like this to inject the TLSA record:</para>

 <screen># <userinput>nsupdate</userinput>
> server localhost
> update add _443._tcp.www.example.com. 3600 IN TLSA 3 0 1 294874DA378148CDD1B9C57D2E891E8C294D2958F0BCA7400A0D6D6F50C4A3BB
> send
> quit</screen>

 <para>Let's talks briefly about the record you just added. The name is a
 specifically formed "_443._tcp.www.example.com", which specifies the usage of
 TCP port 443, for the name "www.example.com". It is followed by three parameters,
 each representing usage, selector, and matching type. For this recipe, we will
 not dissect into all the possible combinations of these parameters. The
 examples listed here are 3, 0, and 1, which represent:</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <simpara>Usage: 3 = self-signed certificate</simpara>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <simpara>Selector 0 = full certificate is included</simpara>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <simpara>Matching Type 1 = SHA-256</simpara>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>If you are interested in learning (a lot) more about the TLSA record type,

 Concept” by Sandoche Balakrichenan, Stephane Bortzmeyer, and Mohsen Souissi
 (April 15, 2013) </citetitle> </ulink> </para>

 <para>Assuming you have successfully added the new TLSA record and generated
 the appropriate signature(s), now you can query for it:</para>

 <screen>$ <userinput>dig _443._tcp.www.example.com. TLSA</userinput>

...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
_443._tcp.www.example.com.	3600 IN	TLSA	3 0 1 294874DA378148CDD1B9C57D2E891E8C294D2958F0BCA7400A0D6D6F 50C4A3BB
...</screen>

 <para>Great! But that's still only half of the equation. We still need to make
 your web browser utilize this new information. For this recipe, we are showing
 you results of using Firefox with a plugin called DNSSEC TLSA Validator from
 <ulink url="https://www.dnssec-validator.cz" />. </para>

 <para>Once the plugin is installed, activated, and Firefox restarted, when you
 visit the URL https://www.example.com, your browser will prompt you for a
 warning, because this is a self-signed certificate:</para>

  </mediaobject>
 </figure>

 <para>Although the certificate is not trusted by the browser itself (if you
 want to you'll have to install a custom CA root or make the browser trust the
 certificate individually), the plugin shows that it was able to verify the
 information it received via HTTPS (port 443), and that it matches the
 information it received via TLSA lookup over DNS (port 53).</para>

 <title>Commonly Asked Questions about DNSSEC</title>
 <para>No questions are too stupid to ask, below is a collection of such questions and answers.</para>

 <qandaset defaultlabel='qanda'>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Do I need IPv6 to have DNSSEC?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No. DNSSEC can be deployed independent of
   IPv6.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Does DNSSEC encrypt my DNS traffic, so others cannot
   eavesdrop on my DNS queries?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No. Although cryptographic keys and digital signatures are
   used in DNSSEC, they only provide authenticity and integrity, not privacy.
   Someone who sniffs network traffic can still see all the DNS queries and
   answers in plain text, DNSSEC just makes it very difficult for the
   eavesdropper to alter or spoof the DNS responses.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Does DNSSEC protect the communication between my laptop and
   my name server?</para></question>
   <answer><para>Unfortunately, no. DNSSEC is a protocol among DNS servers.
   Enabling DNSSEC will change the way your name server communicates with other
   name servers, but not your how your laptop computer or mobile client
   communicates with your recursive server. This communication between the
   recursive server to the clients are commonly called the "last mile", and
   enabling DNSSEC does not enhance security for the last mile.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Does DNSSEC secure zone transfers?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No. You should consider using TSIG to secure zone transfers
   among your name servers.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Is DNSSEC going to protect me from malicious web
   sites?</para></question>
   <answer><para>The answer for now is, unfortunately for early stages of
   DNSSEC deployment, no. DNSSEC is designed so you can have confidence that
   when you received the DNS response for www.isc.org over port 53, you know it
   really came from the ISC name servers, and the answers are authentic. But
   that does not mean the web server you visit over port 80 or port 443 is
   necessarily safe. Further more, 99% of the domain names (as of this writing)
   have not signed their zones yet, so DNSSEC cannot even validate their
   answers.</para>
   <para>The answer for sometime in the future is, as more and more zones are
   signed and more and more recursive servers are validating, DNSSEC will make
   it much more difficult for attackers to spoof DNS responses or perform cache
   poisoning. It still does not protect users from visiting a malicious web
   site that the attacker owns and operates, it just becomes unlikely that the
   attacker can hijack other domain names.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>If I enable DNSSEC validation, will it break DNS lookup for
   majority of the domain names, since most domains names don't have DNSSEC
   yet?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No, DNSSEC is backwards compatible to "standard" DNS. As of
   this writing, although 99% of the .com domains have yet to be signed, a
   DNSSEC-enabled validating resolver can still lookup all of these domain
   names following the "old fashioned way". There are four (4) categories of
   responses (RFC 4035 Sec 4.3):
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara><emphasis>Secure</emphasis>:
      Domains that have DNSSEC deployed correctly</simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara><emphasis>Insecure</emphasis>:
      Domains that have yet to deploy DNSSEC</simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara><emphasis>Bogus</emphasis>:
      Domains that deployed DNSSEC but did it incorrectly</simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara><emphasis>Indeterminate</emphasis>:
      Unable to determine whether or not to use DNSSEC</simpara>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </para>
   <para>A validating resolver will still resolve #1 and #2, only #3 and #4
   will result in a SERVFAIL.You may already be using DNSSEC validation without
   realizing it, since some ISP's have begun enabling DNSSEC validation on
   their recursive name servers. Google public DNS (8.8.8.8) also has enabled
   DNSSEC validation.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Do I need to have special client software to use
   DNSSEC?</para></question>
   <answer><para>The short answer is no, DNSSEC only changes the communication
   behavior among DNS servers, not DNS server (validating resolver) and client
   (stub resolver). With DNSSEC validation enabled on your recursive server, if
   a domain name doesn't pass the checks, an error message (typically SERVFAIL)
   is returned to the clients, and to most client software today, it looks as
   if the DNS query has failed, or the domain name does not exist.</para>
   <para>The longer answer is although you don't have to, you may want to.
   There are more and more client softwares that take advantage of the new
   DNSSEC features and give user better feedback about the domain name they are
   visiting. CZ.NIC Lab's has created a plugin for several popular web
   browsers, and Mozilla has created a new web browser Bloodhound that performs
   DNSSEC validation.</para>
   <para>As DNSSEC deployment becomes more common place, we are sure to see
   more and more software libraries and applications be updated to support its
   features.</para></answer>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Since DNSSEC uses public key cryptography, do I need Public
   Key Infrastructure (PKI) in order to use DNSSEC?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Do I need to purchase SSL certificates from a Certificate
   Authority (CA) to use DNSSEC?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No. With DNSSEC, you generate and publish your own keys, and
   sign your own data as well. There is no need to pay someone else to do it
   for you.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>My parent zone does not support DNSSEC, can I still sign my
   zone?</para></question>
   <answer><para>Technically, yes, you can sign your zone, but you wouldn't be
   getting the full benefit of DNSSEC, as other validating resolvers would not
   be able to validate your zone data. Without the DS record(s) in your parent
   zone, other validating resolvers will treat your zone as an insecure
   (traditional) zone, thus no actual verification is carried out. The end
   result is, to the rest of the world, your zone still appears to be insecure,
   and it will continue to be insecure until your parent zone can host DS
   record(s) for you, effectively telling the rest of the world that your zone
   is signed.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
   <question><para>Is DNSSEC the same thing as TSIG that I have between my
   master and slave servers?</para></question>
   <answer><para>No. TSIG is typically used between master and slave name
   servers to secure zone transfers, DNSSEC secures DNS lookup by validating
   answers. Even if you enabled DNSSEC, zone transfers are still not validated,
   and if you wish to secure the communication between your master and slave
   name servers, you should consider setting up TSIG or similar secure
   channels.</para></answer>

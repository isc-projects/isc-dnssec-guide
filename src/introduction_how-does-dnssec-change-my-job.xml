 <title>How does DNSSEC Change My Job as a DNS Administrator?</title>

 <para>With this protocol extension, some of the things you are used to
 in DNS will change. As the DNS administrator, you will have new
 maintenance tasks to perform on a regular basis (as described in <xref
 linkend="signing-maintenance-tasks" />); when there's a DNS resolution
 problem, you have new troubleshooting techniques and tools to use (as
 described in <xref linkend="dnssec-troubleshooting" />). BIND tries its
 best to make these things as transparent and seamless as possible. In
 this guide, we try to use the configuration examples that result in the
 least amount of work for DNS administrators.</para>
